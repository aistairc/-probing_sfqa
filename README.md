# probing_sfqa
Codes for reproducing the results shown in "Probing simple factoid question answering based on linguistic knowledge", which will be appeared in Journal of Natural Language Processing at 2021 Dec.

All codes and data will be prepared by just running `setup.sh`.

## dependencies
python>3.6, virtualenv.

## how to use
### to prepare BertQA systems and datasets
```
$ sh setup.sh
```
### run BertQA
```
$ sh run_bertqa.sh
```
It assumed that you already download 24 BERT models, three datasets, and BuboQA modules by `setup.sh`.

### run PLSPM analysis
Check `plspm` for the R script and raw data for our experiments.

### evaluate the result of BertQA with reachability accuracy
Check `scripts/reach_acc.py`. It assumed that you already download FB2M data by `setup.sh`.

## datasets
Free917, FreebaseQA, SimpleQuestions, and WebQSP will be prepared by `setup.sh`.

Filtered datasets for simple question answering, F917, FBQ, SQ, and WQ, can be found in `simple-qa-analysis/datasets`.
